                <h5>In Safe Hands</h5>
                <p> Many of us in Northern Ireland have had a history of Trauma.  This can be a single trauma  such as a road traffic accident or more complex issues from our childhood such as violence and abuse.  I am an EMDR Consultant, a therapy that is evidenced based to heal traumatic memories.  I have had many years of experience in working in, "Trouble" affected areas in Belfast where safety and trust are essential.
